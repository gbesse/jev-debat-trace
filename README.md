# Jev Debat Trace

**Trace how arguments from French public debates appear in a project owner later commitments or decisions.**

[![Tests](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-debat-trace/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-debat-trace/actions/workflows/test.yml) [MIT](LICENSE) · Node.js 22+ · Public alpha

## Try it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gbesse/jev-debat-trace.git
cd jev-debat-trace
npm install
npm run demo
```

The demo uses synthetic records and fixture probabilities. It makes no network call and makes no measured quality claim.

## Decision boundary

Project identity, provenance and chronology are enforced in code. Jev compares one sourced contribution with one later commitment. It does not infer representativeness, consensus or project legitimacy.

## Upstream sources

- [https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/saisines-de-la-cndp](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/saisines-de-la-cndp)
- [https://www.debatpublic.fr](https://www.debatpublic.fr)

Keep upstream attribution, original identifiers, source URLs and retrieval dates with derived records.

## Real Jev requests

Real requests are opt-in and paid. The client pins `jev-1.13.0`, validates model identity and probabilities, rejects redirects, retries only network failures plus HTTP 429/529, and refuses state above a conservative 24,000-token estimate.

```sh
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=... node scripts/live-smoke.mjs
```

Never send secrets, personal data or unredacted case files. Evaluate representative French labels before operational use.

## Validation

`npm run validate` runs syntax checks, strict public-type checks, tests and the offline demo. CI runs it on Node.js 22 and 24.
